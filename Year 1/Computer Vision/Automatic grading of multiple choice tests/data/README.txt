Your project should include a README file containing the following information:

1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

Example:

numpy==1.15.4
opencv_python==4.1.1.26
scikit_image==0.15.0
tensorflow_gpu==1.12.0
Pillow==7.0.0
scikit_learn==0.22.1
skimage==0.0
tensorflow==2.1.0

2. how to run each scenario and where to look for the output file.

Example:

Scenario 1: 
script: scenario_1.py
function: predict_grades(input_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the scanned images
output: the output file is results/grades_scanario_1.txt
